# Acknowledgements

Marcelo Pi√±eyro, the main developer of the clew technique, wishes to acknowledge the following people for their contributions to clew:

- Andrew "Kaz" McLamore, for sharing with us his implementation of capturing errors in FileMaker as json objects, and using the single-pass loop technique as a pseudo "try" block
- Ken Worthley, for his insights into the original implementation of clew, and for writing the function that is now called error.InSubscriptRethrow
- Anders Monsen, for coming up with the name "clew", and being one of the early adopters of the technique
- My various other Soliant colleagues, whom provided valuable insights and feedback which helped clew be what it is today
